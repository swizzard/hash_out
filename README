Tools to retrieve and process tweets.

get_tweets.py contains several classes and various functions to retrieve tweets via the Twitter API, both streaming and search-based.

tokenize_hash.py is a work-in-progress. Eventually it will tokenize hashtags into lists of words. Ignore it for now.

tweets.json and tweets2.json contain get_tweets.ParsedTweet objects encoded as JSON.
